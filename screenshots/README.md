# 🧪 Basic Home Network Lab

## 📌 Overview
This lab was part of my CompTIA A+ hands-on practice. I explored my home network, configured a static IP, accessed my router settings, and used key networking commands to test connectivity and understand internal routing.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Windows Command Prompt (`ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`)
- Web browser (for router access)
- Router admin dashboard
- GitHub (for documentation)
- Static IP setup

---

## 🧩 Lab Steps Performed

### 1. Checked Network Configuration
- Identified default gateway, IP address, subnet mask
- Used `ipconfig` to see current settings

### 2. Logged Into Router
- Accessed admin panel using gateway IP
- Viewed connected devices
- Changed SSID and admin password (if permitted)

### 3. Configured Static IP
- Manually set static IP: `192.168.1.100`
- DNS: `8.8.8.8`, Gateway: `192.168.1.1`

### 4. Ran Network Tests
- Used `ping 8.8.8.8` to test internet reachability
- Used `tracert google.com` to view hop path

## 📘 What I Learned
- How IP addressing works in local networks
- Importance of DNS, DHCP, and static IPs
- Using network commands for basic troubleshooting
- Gained comfort with home router configurations
